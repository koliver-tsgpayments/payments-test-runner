## TODO

- [X] Follow up with manager on the `constraints/gcp.resourceLocations` org policy. Current allowed values are `global`, `us`, and `in:us-central1-locations`, which blocks deploying Cloud Functions to regions like `us-east4`. Request an exception or update the policy if broader coverage is required.
